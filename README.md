## My process
First : designed the layout for desktop using html and css(grid and flex mainly)
Second : added proper parameters to the components(such as color, pading, fontsize, fontfamily etc)
Third : added the javascript and neccesary ids to the component.
Fourth : made it responsive.

### Built with
-HTML
-CSS
-JAVASCRIPT

### What I learned
I found out a new way to access class in javascript using map and reduce the overwritinig. I was not sure about it at the starting but it worked at once. I think the best part of this project is the javascript file thats here. Its a pure javascript and nothing extraordinary.

I also polished my skills on grids and once learned grid in css its always a advantage
